Questions for investigation.
1. Implementation.
1.1. Is REPA for the last layer implemented correctly?
1.2. Are we using chemprop correctly?
1.3. Are we getting the final representation for the REPA encoder in the same way that the paper does it?
2. Why are the PoseBusters metrics not being captured right now?
3. Why are the training runs failing on the HPC?
4. Metrics
4.1. PoseBusters
4.2. Is convergence faster?
